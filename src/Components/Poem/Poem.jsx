          Where form is continuum of space,<br />

          where color defies barrier of definition,<br />
          where specificity meets abstract,<br />
          where expression is more than just instinct,<br />
          where wisdom meets silence,<br />
          where reflections are swept by haze of ripples,<br />
          where answers question answers,<br />
          where metamorphosis ravages delusion of time,<br />
          where absence meets presence,<br />
          In that Horizon O Lord let Consciousness awake.
